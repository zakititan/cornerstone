# Launch Plan Buddy

> A calm, step-by-step guide that helps small-business owners go from "I need a website" to "My business is live online."

Launch Plan Buddy is a guided web application for non-technical small-business owners who need to set up a domain, choose a website approach, create a professional online presence, configure business email, and launch safely.

Instead of overwhelming people with technical jargon or pushing a single provider, Launch Plan Buddy turns website setup into a personalized roadmap: one clear task at a time.

## What it solves

Launching a first business website often means facing unfamiliar concepts, conflicting provider advice, account-access risks, and dozens of setup decisions. Launch Plan Buddy helps users work through questions such as:

- What is the difference between a domain, hosting, a website builder, and DNS?
- Which website setup is appropriate for my business?
- How can I connect a domain without breaking business email?
- What content and pages does a professional business website need?
- How can I make the site work on mobile and become easier for customers to find?
- How do I make sure that the business owner—not an agency, contractor, or former employee—controls key online accounts?

The product explains technical choices in plain English, guides users through safe next steps, and keeps launch work organized in an actionable plan.

## Who it is for

Launch Plan Buddy is built for small-business owners with limited technical experience, including:

- Local service businesses such as salons, tradespeople, consultants, tutors, repair shops, and clinics
- Restaurants, cafés, bakeries, and home-food businesses
- Freelancers, independent professionals, coaches, and creators
- Retailers and small ecommerce businesses
- Charities, community groups, and early-stage founders

It is especially useful for people who have a business name or social-media presence but no domain or website, already own a domain but do not know what to do next, are replacing an older website, or need clarity over accounts currently managed by someone else.

## Product capabilities

### Personalized launch roadmap

Users complete a short onboarding flow covering their business type, goals, current setup, website requirements, budget, timeline, and technical comfort. The app creates a tailored plan across these stages:

1. Plan the online presence
2. Secure the domain
3. Choose a website approach
4. Create core website pages
5. Connect domain, website, and email safely
6. Test and launch
7. Improve discoverability and maintain the site

Each stage contains practical tasks, plain-language guidance, estimated effort, and progress tracking.

### Domain and digital ownership guidance

The app helps owners understand and safeguard the online assets their business depends on:

- Domain and registrar account
- Website platform or hosting account
- DNS provider
- Business email provider
- Analytics and search-monitoring accounts
- Payment, booking, and social-media accounts

The guidance emphasizes owner-controlled accounts, recovery details, two-factor authentication, renewal reminders, and documented access. The Digital Ownership Record provides a dedicated place to track service ownership and recovery responsibility without storing secrets.

### Domain name helper

The domain helper suggests business-appropriate name formats and evaluates them through simple criteria:

- Clarity
- Memorability
- Ease of spelling
- Local relevance
- Brand flexibility
- Potential confusion

The app does not claim that a domain is available unless a live domain lookup integration is connected. It provides practical name ideas and directs users to verify availability with a registrar.

### Website platform matcher

An interactive decision tool guides owners toward a category of website setup rather than forcing a provider choice.

| Setup category                        | Best suited to                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy all-in-one website builder       | Owners who want a straightforward, low-maintenance site quickly        |
| Ecommerce-first platform              | Businesses selling products online                                     |
| Flexible CMS with managed hosting     | Businesses needing more flexibility and room to grow                   |
| Professional designer/developer build | Businesses with complex requirements or a larger implementation budget |
| Simple one-page launch site           | Owners who need an immediate, focused online presence                  |

The matcher describes the advantages, trade-offs, maintenance expectations, feature fit, and questions owners should ask before purchasing.

### DNS connection center

DNS is often the most intimidating part of launching a website. The connection center breaks it into guided actions and explains records such as A, CNAME, TXT, and MX records in practical language.

It includes:

- A pre-change checklist
- DNS record tables with copy actions
- Plain-English explanations of each record
- Completion states for guided steps
- Provider-agnostic troubleshooting flows
- Warnings to preserve existing mail-related records

> **Important:** DNS changes can affect both websites and business email. Users are warned not to delete unknown records and not to remove email-related records unless they are intentionally changing email providers.

### Website content builder

The content workspace helps owners prepare the essential information for a credible business site. It supports guided drafts for:

- Home
- About
- Services
- Products
- Contact
- Booking
- Menu
- Portfolio
- Testimonials
- FAQ
- Privacy and business-policy pages

Each page includes a purpose statement, recommended sections, fill-in-the-blank prompts, quality checks, and editable AI-assisted drafting placeholders.

### Launch checklist

The central checklist organizes required, recommended, and optional launch tasks across:

- Account ownership and recovery
- Website content and contact details
- Mobile usability, links, forms, and accessibility basics
- Domain connection, redirects, HTTPS, and email preservation
- Search and local business visibility
- Analytics and conversion tracking
- Post-launch review and maintenance

Users can filter work, add notes, assign tasks to teammates or contractors, and monitor their launch readiness.

### Business email guide

A guided business-email section helps owners plan and set up professional addresses such as `hello@yourbusiness.com`, `support@yourbusiness.com`, or `bookings@yourbusiness.com`. It covers mailbox planning, mobile setup, signatures, recovery settings, and introductory SPF, DKIM, and DMARC guidance.

### Search and local presence

The discoverability guide focuses on durable fundamentals rather than ranking promises:

- Clear page titles, headings, and navigation
- Original, useful service and product descriptions
- Mobile-friendly and secure pages
- Consistent business name, address, phone number, hours, and service-area details
- Search-monitoring setup and ownership verification
- Sitemap and indexing guidance where supported
- Practical content ideas tailored to business type

### Ongoing maintenance

The maintenance center helps owners protect their investment after launch, with recurring reminders for reviewing enquiries, testing forms, updating offers and hours, checking analytics, reviewing account access, refreshing content, and monitoring domain renewal.

### Functional growth sprint — five new capabilities

Recent work connects the launch workflow end-to-end. All data stays in local storage and is not sent to a server.

- **Launch readiness scoring and blockers** — Deterministic checks over tasks, business essentials and customer-journey results. Shows overall completion and required-task completion separately (both with semantic color plus text/icons), lists up to 3 blockers with severity badges, plain-English why sentences and route links, filters blockers in the checklist (`/checklist?filter=blockers`), and exposes a next-action button. Guidance only — not a guarantee.
- **Customer journey tester (`/customer-journey`)** — Five-step flow: choose a goal, prepare, tailored steps, record outcome, summary. Supports 8 journey types (phone, WhatsApp, form, booking, purchase, visit, newsletter, custom) with inferred default from onboarding, 5–6 plain-English hints, per-step Passed / Needs improvement / Blocked / Not tested with notes, mark-all-passed and reset, summary counts with readiness impact, and links to checklist, dashboard and hire-help.
- **Saved domain shortlist (`/domains` → shortlist)** — Save ideas with normalized deduplication, statuses (Considering / Preferred — only one at a time / Backup / Rejected / Purchased), notes, local 0–10 scores (clarity, memorability, spelling ease, local relevance, brand flexibility), RDAP outcome with checkedAt messaging, table + mobile cards, compare up to 5 side-by-side, and handoff wiring to Business Profile preferred domain, readiness, ownership and hire-help.
- **Unified business profile workspace (`/business-profile`)** — One place for basics, location/service area, contact & primary customer action, brand & trust, and online setup. Shows completion percentage with per-section progress, essentials banner for readiness, pre-filled from onboarding, and downstream wiring to dashboard greetings, content builder, journey defaults, get-found and hire-help.
- **Professional handoff brief (`/hire-help`)** — Local-only brief compiled from business profile, onboarding, domain shortlist, launch plan, content drafts, journey test, ownership and readiness. Never sent to a server; user shares via copy, print/Save as PDF or download (.txt/.md). Includes completed/open tasks, blockers, journey status, domain/technical snapshot, no-password ownership checklist and eight questions to ask a professional.

Cross-feature wiring: onboarding → profile prefill; profile → dashboard/content/journey/get-found/handoff; shortlist → profile/readiness/ownership/handoff; journey → readiness/checklist/handoff; readiness → dashboard/checklist/handoff; ownership → domain/handoff; content → journey/handoff. All internal links use `Link` from `@tanstack/react-router` with no `href="#"` placeholders.

> No backend, authentication, PDF service or analytics backend is live in this sprint — storage is local-only and printing uses the browser dialog.

## Application routes

The product includes guided workflow pages, support resources, account flows, legal information, and a branded fallback for unknown URLs.

### Unknown paths

Unknown URLs are handled by a friendly, branded 404 route rather than a blank page or generic framework error. The fallback gives users clear recovery actions for Home, Dashboard, plan creation, and learning resources.

## Dark mode

Launch Plan Buddy includes a global appearance system with three preferences:

- **Light**
- **Dark**
- **Use device settings**

The theme selection is persisted locally and is available from Settings and the application’s navigation. The visual system is designed to keep core workflow elements—cards, forms, tables, task states, DNS warnings, modals, tooltips, and navigation—readable and consistent in both light and dark themes.

Dark mode uses semantic design tokens rather than ad-hoc color overrides so the application can apply consistent surfaces, text contrast, borders, status states, and focus indicators across public pages, dashboard pages, and support flows.

## Design principles

- **Plain English first:** technical terms are introduced only when needed and explained immediately.
- **Progress over perfection:** users can move forward one useful task at a time.
- **Ownership and safety:** critical business accounts should remain under business-owner control.
- **Provider neutrality:** recommendations are based on needs and trade-offs, not a forced vendor choice.
- **No false guarantees:** the app does not promise rankings, uptime, legal compliance, domain availability, or third-party provider outcomes.
- **Progressive disclosure:** beginner guidance appears first; advanced details are available when useful.
- **Accessible by default:** the app supports semantic structure, keyboard use, visible focus states, readable contrast, responsive layouts, and light/dark/system appearance preferences.
- **No dead ends:** internal links lead to a route, a meaningful state, or a friendly fallback—not a 404.

## Example user scenario

**Harbor & Hearth Bakery** is a local bakery that wants to display its menu, receive custom-cake orders, use WhatsApp for enquiries, and establish a credible local online presence.

A personalized plan can recommend:

1. Select and register a simple, owner-controlled domain.
2. Choose an easy all-in-one website approach supporting a menu, photo gallery, enquiry form, and WhatsApp contact.
3. Prepare Home, Menu, About, Custom Cake Orders, and Contact pages.
4. Add real product images, business hours, location, and clear ordering instructions.
5. Set up a professional business email address.
6. Connect the domain while preserving any existing email configuration.
7. Test the website and enquiry path on mobile and desktop.
8. Set up search monitoring and local-profile basics.
9. Schedule monthly content and access reviews.

## Technical direction

The project uses a modern TypeScript web stack and a file-based route structure.

- **Frontend:** React and TypeScript
- **Routing:** TanStack Router file-based routes
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and semantic design tokens
- **UI direction:** reusable components and accessible controls
- **Icons:** Lucide
- **Theme:** global light, dark, and system-preference support with local persistence
- **Future backend/authentication/persistence:** Supabase-compatible architecture
- **Guest experience:** local persistence for in-progress plans
- **Future integrations:** domain lookup, AI content generation, analytics, calendar reminders, search-monitoring tools, and PDF export

Suggested data entities:

```text
profiles
businesses
business_requirements
launch_plans
launch_tasks
domain_profiles
website_content_drafts
maintenance_tasks
learning_progress
```

## Security and privacy

Launch Plan Buddy should not store:

- Passwords
- Account-recovery codes
- DNS credentials
- Payment-card information

When a backend is connected, use least-privilege access patterns, keep API secrets server-side, and design persistence with row-level-security readiness. The app should support guest mode, account creation, saved plans, privacy controls, and a data-deletion path.

Users should never send passwords, recovery codes, DNS credentials, or payment information through support forms.

## Accessibility and UX

The user experience should remain calm, clear, and usable by beginners.

- Use semantic HTML, accessible labels, keyboard navigation, and visible focus states.
- Maintain legible contrast in light and dark modes.
- Do not rely on color alone to communicate task, warning, or error state.
- Use clear inline validation and practical error messages.
- Include loading, empty, success, and fallback states.
- Prefer descriptive controls such as “Create my launch plan,” “Mark task complete,” and “Copy DNS value.”
- Avoid introducing complex DNS and security details before the user needs them.

## AI-assisted capabilities

AI features should assist—not replace—the business owner’s judgment. Planned capabilities include:

- Personalized roadmap generation
- Domain-name ideas
- Homepage headline and service-description drafts
- FAQ and local-content ideas
- Simplified explanations of technical terms
- Next-priority task recommendations
- Launch-plan gap analysis
- Project-brief generation for freelancers or agencies

Every generated result should offer edit, regenerate, and copy controls, plus a reminder to review content for accuracy before publishing.
