  },
  {
    q: "Why is my email going to spam?",
    a: "Usually because the sending permissions on your domain are incomplete. Ask your email provider for their SPF, DKIM and DMARC values and add exactly those.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many mailboxes do I need?",
    a: "One shared address is enough for most one-person businesses. Add more only when someone actually needs their own.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to email if I move my website?",
    a: "Nothing, provided you leave your mail records alone. Website records and mail records are separate settings that live in the same place.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a paid mailbox to look professional?",
    a: "You need an address at your own domain. Whether it is a paid mailbox or an included one matters far less than not using a free personal address for business.",
